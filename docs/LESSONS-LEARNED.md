# Troubleshooting lessons from the actual platform

These are historical engineering incidents summarized from maintained internal records. They are not newly reproduced tests, a fresh cloud inventory or instructions to repeat a consumed operation. Names, resource identifiers, private payloads and credentials are excluded.

## Docker worked, but emulated workloads crashed

**What happened.** The workstation could run its Linux engine, while x64 browser or SQL workloads failed under emulation.

**What the evidence showed.** The host engine was ARM64. Recorded Chromium QEMU failures and a SQL Server signal-11 failure concerned emulated workloads; they did not establish that Docker was absent, the engine was unreachable or the application would fail on native x64.

**What changed and how it was checked.** The process kept the failed receipts and used the existing native x64 validation path where that runtime was required. ACR native builds retained their verification stage; a classic builder rejecting RUN --network=none was handled with an explicit BuildKit task, not by removing the network restriction.

**What to carry forward.** Check CLI installation, engine reachability, architecture and workload compatibility independently. Publishing an earlier runtime stage or passing a different-architecture test does not prove the final intended image ran its browser or SQL checks.

## Related incident

[Remote script completion evidence](https://github.com/truthofsource/platform-operations-and-recovery/blob/main/docs/LESSONS-LEARNED.md) explains the shared failure and verification. Its historical acceptance is not another hosted test performed for this repository.

## Evidence and project boundaries

The local examples and screenshots in this repository remain separate from the dated hosted incidents above. A new documentation summary does not establish another successful deployment, restore, security scan or business transaction. Follow the repository’s existing validation guide for the commands and limits of the runnable reference.

The practical sequence is: identify the failing boundary, preserve safe correlation evidence, reconcile any uncertain result, apply only the relevant repair and verify the resulting state. A completed local command is not interchangeable with a completed cloud operation.
